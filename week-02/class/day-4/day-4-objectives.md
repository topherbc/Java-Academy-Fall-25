What did you learn yesterday?

1. switch statement
   1. a conditional statement
   2. Only used to if a value is equal to a series of values
2. Overloading Constructors
3. Overloading Methods
   1. Same method, different signature
      1. different signature means method name and return is the same, different parameters
4. Classes are the instructions for building/constructing objects
5. Generating getters/setters/constructors
6. CMD + F == find within a page
7. In classes, properties can be defined on the same line
   1. ex. private int x, y, z;

What did you learn today?

1. Iteration
   1. Repeating a process/action
   2. Produces incremental change
2. Loops
   1. while loop
   2. for loop
      1. For range
      2. Defines the counters in parameter list
      3. i is standard first for variable
         1. i stands for iteration
   3. do / while loop
3. Arrays
   1. Only ONE DATA TYPE
   2. Arrays are limited to a defined amount of positions
   3. index start at 0
   4. index is the value position in array
   5. Arrays.sort()
   6. variable = new Class[variable.length + 1]
4. Last Index of an Array is always array.length - 1
5. switch cases need break;
6. Switches are great to check against a list of possible values
