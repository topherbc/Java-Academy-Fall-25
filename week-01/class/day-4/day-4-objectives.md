What did you learn yesterday?

1. CRLF - Carriage Return Line Feed
2. Scanner - Reads input from screen
   1. must have import java.util.Scanner;
   2. Scanner varName = new Scanner(System.in)
   3. .nextLine() - Reads everything entered before a new line/CRLF/\n
   4. .nextFloat()
   5. .nextDouble() - Reads only doubles
   6. .nextBoolean() - Reads only booleans
   7. .nextInt() - reads only Ints
3. Print methods - Output to screen
   1. System.out.println(); - prints with new line character
   2. System.out.print(); - prints without new lines
   3. System.out.printf();  - printing with formatting
4. print formatting
   1. souf + tab = System.out.printf()
   2. System.out.printf() -- allows inserting variables into placeholders
   3. Format Specifiers - placeholders
      1. %s - String
      2. %d - ints/numbers
      3. %.2f - floating points (.2 represents how many decimals to show, so 2 decimals)
5. \n
6. Math Methods
   1. Math.max()
   2. Math.min()
7. DETAILS MATTER

What did you learn today?

1. Debugging
2. Logic is the prediction of what is possible
3. Methods - functions
   1. Method Syntax: public static datatype nameOfMethod(argDataType argName) {}
   2. does something
   3. void - returns no value
   4. datatype requred when returning
   5. args are optional
4. Conditions are propositions to be acted upon
   1. if
   2. else if
   3. else
5. Logical Operators
   1. &&
   2. || == OR
   3. ! == not/bang
6. Comparisson Operators
   1. ==
   2. !=
   3. <
   4. >
   5. <=
   6. >=
   7. .equals() - comparing strings
   8. .equalsIgnoreCase() - comparing strings ignoring the casing
7. Format Specifier Tricks
   1. When formatting with a percent, we need double Ex. printf("%%")
8. D.R.Y. - Don't Repeat Yourself
9. It is recommended to step away when stressing
