What did you learn today?

1. Variables
2. Defining variables
   1. String name = "double quotes"
3. Data Types
   1. String - set of characters
      1. define with double quotes
      2. Ex. String name = "name";
   2. int - whole number
   3. long - bigger whole number
      1. Define with L
      2. long number = 10000000000L;
   4. char - single character
      1. define with single quotes
      2. Ex. char singleCharacter = 'C';
   5. double - 64 bit - Larger decimal value
      1. just use em
      2. Ex. double price = 1.5;
   6. float - 32 bit - Smaller decimal value
      1. define with f
      2. EX. float price = 1.5f;
   7. boolean - true/false
4. Java Math Class
5. Combining words is concatenation or concat
6. Java Syntax
   1. {} curly brace
   2. ;  semicolon - ends line of code
   3. Casing matters!
7. Java Naming Conventions
   1. variables are lowerCamelCase
      1. int numberOfWeek = 8;
   2. Class is UpperCamelCase
      1. Main
8. Java is old?? maybe
9.  JDK is our Java Development Kit
   1. Our toolbox
   2. Where Java version and libraries exist
10. LTS is Long Term Support
   1.  Long term support for app versions
11. Java Shortcuts
    1.  sout + tab autocomplete System.out.println();
12. Java Comments
    1.  /** block comment */
    2.  //single line comment
13. JAVA != JavaScript
14. JRE - Java Runtime Environment
15. Java is Strictly Typed and Memory is important
16. Java operators
    1.  +
    2.  -
    3.  *
    4.  /
    5.  % - modulus
    6. += - add and assign
    7. ++ - adds 1 to a variable
